I am a marine biogeochemist working at NOAA, Pacific Marine Environmental Labolatory. My research interests are centered around biogeochemical cycles in the ocean, with the objective constraining the mechanism governing the carbon and oxygen cycling in the context of a changing climate. I combine a wide spectrum of scientific approaches including deck incubations, biogeochemical sensor data from autonomous platforms, satellite observations, as well as statistical and biogeochemical modeling.More specifically, I focus on:


* Biogeochemical cycling of carbon and oxygen
* Biological pump and ocean productivity
* Autonomous platforms observations
* Physical and biochemical controls on planktonic and bacterial metabolism
* Marine ecology
