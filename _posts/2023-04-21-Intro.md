**I am a marine biogeochemist working at NOAA, Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory**. My research interests are centered around biogeochemical cycles in the ocean, with the objective of constraining the mechanism governing carbon and oxygen cycling in the context of a changing climate. I combine a wide spectrum of scientific approaches including deck incubations, biogeochemical sensor data from autonomous platforms, satellite observations, as well as statistical and biogeochemical modeling. More specifically, I focus on:

* Biological pump and ocean productivity
* Biogeochemical cycling of carbon and oxygen
* Autonomous platforms observations
* Physical and biochemical controls on planktonic and bacterial metabolism
* Marine Ecology
