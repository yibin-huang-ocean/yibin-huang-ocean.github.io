I am currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Marine Chemistry at the Xiamen University, China.

My research interests are centered around biogeochemical cycles in the ocean, with the objective constraining the mechanism governing the carbon and oxygen cycling in the context of a changing climate. I combine a wide spectrum of scientific approaches including deck incubations, biogeochemical sensor data from autonomous platforms, satellite observations, as well as statistical and biogeochemical models to conduct my research.

I am currently recruiting several students and postdocs in my lab. Please contact me to inquire for more information about the opening position and application procedure.

More fun to come!
