I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (NOAA PMEL) in Seattle at the Global Observations of Biogeochemistry and Ocean Physics Group, with joint appointment by University of California, Santa Cruz.

My research interests are centered around biogeochemical cycles in the ocean, with the objective constraining the mechanism governing the carbon and oxygen cycling in the context of a changing climate. I combine a wide spectrum of scientific approaches including deck incubations, biogeochemical sensor data from autonomous platforms, satellite observations, as well as statistical and biogeochemical models to conduct my research.

More fun to come!
