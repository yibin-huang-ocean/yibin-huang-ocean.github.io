## Constraining Upper-Ocean Carbon Export with Biogeochemical Profiling Floats:  Toward Persistent Training and Validation of Satellite Carbon Export Algorithms

>  I am currently working on an NSF-funded project associated with NASA EXPORTS that incorporates data from multiple biogeochemical profiling floats, a mooring, and ships in the eastern subarctic Pacific. We are using these data to constrain upper-ocean tracer budgets to quantify carbon cycling and export over multiple years. The goal of the project is to improve understanding of the biological carbon pump and its predictability from remote sensing. <br/>
